This project is a responsive SPA that shows jokes about Chuck Norris.
They can be chosen by text search or category, but not both
 (because of external API behaviour). In case
 text and category are chosen, text search will be executed.

## How to use
1. Go to backend folder and execute `npm start`
2. After the backend startup is complete, go to 
frontend folder and execute `npm start`
3. It will pop up a browser window with the page after a few seconds.

Note: data from Chuck Norris API is fetched by backend. By this reason, 
backend could
be removed for now. Although it exists because it was created for 
functionalities that may be implemented in the future.
